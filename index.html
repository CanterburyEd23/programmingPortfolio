                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio website.  I'm Ed Hampton, a Canterbury based programmer who is very much a new entrant into the exciting world of programming, having recently left a career as a chef to study full-time.
                    I'm currently part way through Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer course, though this is just one section of the package of re-training courses I am undertaking in order to switch careers.  
                    Much as the leap to leave a safe and familiar job for the unknown was a big one, I am pleased with my progress so far, and excited about the new skills I'm learning and the possibilities for my future that they bring!</p>
                <h3>About this Website</h3>
                <p>This Website is my portfolio, such as it is.  Currently, this is largely projects completed as part of my Codecademy course, many of them built with a lot of hand-holding and to very precise specifications, 
                    leaving little room to show any creativity or individual skill beyond ability to follow instructions.  However, as I progress, more interesting course projects, and some personal projects, are being added!</p>
